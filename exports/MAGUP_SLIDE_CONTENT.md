## Slide 4 — Key Shift in Brand Growth in the AI Era

### Core Elements & User Decision Shift

**Core Element Shift**: In the AI Era, brand growth depends on higher visibility, not more exposure.

**User Decision Path Change**:
- Past Marketing: Advertising → User Sees → Understands
- Current Users: Ask AI → Get Answer → Verify → Decide to Buy

### Visibility Flywheel Growth Model

Become the Answer → Win Trust → Facilitate Transaction → (repeat)

### Flywheel's Three Key Positions Operational Guide

**Answer Position Key Points:**
- When potential customers ask AI or search engines, the brand must appear in the answer; it's the first entry point for user decision.

**Capture Method:**
- Clarify → Evidence → Distribution
- Comparison Pages, Buying Guides, FAQ
- Spec Sheets, Case Studies, Review Aggregation
- These are citable, judgeable, actionable hard-core information.

**Mindshare Position Key Points:**
- Solve user trust issues, establish brand credibility in the user's mind.

**Endorsement Types:**
- Authoritative (Media/Agency Reports)
- Peer Endorsement (Industry Experts, KOLs)
- Real User Proof (Community Word-of-Mouth)

**Transaction Position Key Points:**
- As the reception system, convert user trust into orders.
- Promise Must Be Consistent (landing page content consistent with AI/Influencer statements)
- Evidence Must Be Visible (Move trust-building evidence to the landing page)
- Action Path Must Be Shortest (Provide clear packages and simple purchase process)

## Slide 7 — Market Size Evolution

**Market Size Evolution: From Search Engine Era to AI Intelligent Promotion Era**

### Traditional Search Engine Market (SEO + SEM)
- **Stock Competition**
- Passive search based on keywords
- Red ocean competition, high traffic costs
- Only covers Search Engine Results Pages (SERP)
- Market Size: Billion/Trillion Level (Growth Slowing)
- **Current Market Size (Estimated)**: Approx. $500 Billion USD (Growth Slowing)

### Historic Paradigm Shift: From "Search" to "Generation and Recommendation"

### AI Intelligent Promotion Era GEO Market
- **Unlimited Increment**
- **Future Market Potential (Forecast)**: Projected over $10 Trillion USD (Exponential Explosion)

> Conclusion: GEO is not just an upgrade of search, but creates a new growth battlefield that is vaster and has more potential than traditional SEO+SEM.

---

## Slide 8 — SEO vs GEO Comparison

**From "Progressive Ranking" to "Zero-Sum Game": The Logical Reconstruction of SEO and GEO**

### Traditional Google SEO (Linear Distribution)
- Traffic gradually decreases with ranking, but the long tail still survives
- **Display Space (Broad)**: Unlimited Pagination — Home page, Page 2, Page 3...
- **High Tolerance**: Even if not in TOP 3, ranking 5-15 still offers exposure and click traffic
- **Result Feedback**: 30–90 Points — Progressive Gains
- Current State: Even pages with 30 or 60 points can still capture some long-tail traffic

### Gemini GEO (Cliff-Edge/Binary Opposition)
- Seats are extremely scarce, it's win or lose
- **Display Space (Extremely Limited)**: Single Window — AI directly generates answers
- **Golden Seats**: Only cites 5-10 high-authority sources (Sources/Citations)

### Strategic Insight
> In the GEO era, the goal of optimization is no longer to improve ranking position (Ranking), but to vie to become AI's factual source (Authority). We are either the top 5% absolute authority, or we are invisible to Gemini.

## Slide 9 — Core Value of GEO
