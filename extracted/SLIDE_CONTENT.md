## Slide 2 — The Shift

**SEO is Linear. GEO is Binary.**

Search demand hasn't changed — but the entry points are shifting fast.

**Traditional Google SEO** follows a linear distribution model. Traffic drops gradually with ranking, but the long tail still survives. Even pages scoring 30-60 points capture some traffic. Sites climb from position 10 to 1, and multiple results coexist on page one.

**Generative Engine (GEO)** is a cliff-edge game. AI generates a single answer window and cites only 5-10 high-authority sources. You're either the cited answer or you're invisible. There is no page two. There is no long tail.

The goal of optimization is no longer improving ranking position — it's becoming AI's factual source. You're either in the top 5% of absolute authority, or Gemini doesn't know you exist.

- **34×** gap between traditional search (1,631B visits/mo) and AI chatbots (55B visits/mo)
- **1,000×** growth rate across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, and DeepSeek
- **60%** of searches now end without a click — AI answers the question directly

## Slide 3 — Proven Results

**From Invisible to #1 — Robot Vacuum Case Study**

A leading robot vacuum brand was completely absent from AI recommendations. When users asked Gemini "Which robot vacuum has the best smart navigation?" — competitors owned every answer. Brand visibility: 0%.

After GEO optimization targeting high-value queries around smart navigation and suction power, the brand became the top recommendation across Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and DeepSeek.

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Brand Mentions | Baseline | **+450%** |
| Share of Voice | Invisible | **#1 Position** |
| Sentiment Score | — | Positive (Trust) |
| Direct Traffic from AI | Baseline | **+30%** |
| AI Platforms Covered | 0 | **4** (Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity, DeepSeek) |

---

## Slide 4 — Market Data

**AI Search Is Reshaping Discovery**

All search engines combined: **1,631.5 billion** visits per month (Google alone at 60.19%).

All AI chatbots combined: **55.2 billion** visits per month — and growing at rates exceeding 1,000×.

| Platform | Monthly Visits |
|----------|---------------|
| ChatGPT | 164.5M |
| DeepSeek | 218.5M |
| Perplexity | 920.4M |

The traditional SEO+SEM market sits at roughly **$500 billion** with growth slowing. The AI-driven GEO market is projected to exceed **$10 trillion** — not an upgrade of search, but an entirely new battlefield.

Companies that prioritize high-quality content now capture early traffic dividends and lock in long-term brand equity.

## Slide 5 — The Challenge

**6 Walls Enterprises Hit When Going Global with Content**

1. **Discovery Wall** — Website built well but gets no traffic. Doesn't fit Google's rules. Page homogeneity tanks indexing. AI crawlers skip you entirely.

2. **Credibility Wall** — Content reads like marketing copy, not expertise. Traces of machine translation. Lacks the professionalism that earns citations.

3. **Brand Wall** — Insufficient overseas awareness. No understanding of local culture. Over-reliance on a single promotion channel.

4. **Talent Wall** — Team hasn't done overseas content before. No foreign-language writing capability. Relevant hires are expensive and scarce.

5. **Operations Wall** — No content strategy. No operation planning. No professional tooling or playbooks to follow.

6. **ROI Wall** — Outsourcing is expensive with poor results. In-house content production is slow. Trial-and-error cycles drag on for months.

## Slide 7 — Growth Model

**The Visibility Flywheel**

In the AI era, brand growth depends on higher visibility — not more exposure. The user decision path has fundamentally changed:

**Old path**: Advertising → User Sees → Understands → Maybe Buys
**New path**: User Asks AI → Gets Answer → Verifies → Decides to Buy

The flywheel runs on three positions:

**Answer Position** — When potential customers ask AI or search engines, your brand must appear in the answer. This is the first entry point for every user decision. Build it with comparison pages, buying guides, FAQs, spec sheets, case studies, and review aggregation. Citable, judgeable, actionable information.

**Mindshare Position** — Solve user trust issues and establish credibility. Three endorsement types: authoritative (media/agency reports), peer (industry experts, KOLs), and real user proof (community word-of-mouth).

**Transaction Position** — Convert trust into orders. Landing page content must be consistent with what AI and influencers say about you. Evidence must be visible. The purchase path must be the shortest possible.

Become the Answer → Win Trust → Facilitate Transaction → Reinforce → (repeat)

## Slide 10 — Strategy

**Three-Phase GEO Framework: From Indexing to Recognition to Recommendation**

### Phase 1: Expand Sources — Ensure Being Found
Make your brand a credible, positive information source when AI generates content. Structured data conversion — turn long articles into AI-friendly structured formats. Build a centralized, authoritative "Brand Knowledge Base" that AI can pull from.

### Phase 2: Build Reputation — Ensure Being Recognized
Optimize content semantics around GEO performance strategies. Invite industry experts and practitioners to create endorsement content. Write white papers and industry reports that establish authority. Manage the brand's image in the eyes of every AI model.

### Phase 3: Gain Recommendations — Ensure Being Adopted
Adapt content into forms suitable for various AI scenarios — images, data tables, multimodal formats. Monitor AI citation effectiveness with tracking tools. Analyze mention rates, traffic feedback, user evaluations. Influence AI to recommend your brand, rather than passively waiting for user clicks.

| SEO | 68/100 | Average |
| AEO | 31/100 | Weak |
| GEO | 18/100 | Critical |

This is what most enterprise brands look like before GEO optimization. Strong-ish SEO, almost nonexistent in AI answers.
